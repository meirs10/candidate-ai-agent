Adaptive phrase tracking for document generation.

Tracks n-gram frequencies across generated documents and identifies
overused LLM-isms using TF-IDF-style logic. Phrases that are common
in general English (e.g., 'worked with', 'was responsible for') are
not penalized, while LLM-specific patterns (e.g., 'rare blend of',
'instrumental in shaping') are flagged.

Usage:
    tracker = PhraseTracker()
    # After each document is generated:
    tracker.ingest(doc_text)
    # Before generating the next document:
    banned = tracker.get_banned_phrases(top_k=10)
